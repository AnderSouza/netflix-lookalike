# Netflix Lookalike

Netflix landing page lookalike.

:fist_oncoming: This project was created as a challenge. 

It's not an exact clone, it's a lookalike. The purpose is to show what I can do.

The page is responsive and the videos showcasing movies and the Netflix App are also responsive.
Proper use of the CSS position property was key in this layout.
